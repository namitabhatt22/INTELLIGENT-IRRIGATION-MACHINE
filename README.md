# INTELLIGENT-IRRIGATION-MACHINE
Aautomating the watering of farm parcels by making an intelligent irrigation machine. So classes/labels are not mutually exclusive, the machine could water all, none or any combination of farm parcels based on the inputs. Done by making sequential model using keras, tensorflow

PROBLEM STATEMENT --> 
A farm field has an array of 20 sensors distributed along 3 crop fields. 
These sensors measure, among other things, the humidity of the soil, radiation of the sun, etc. 
Machine's task is to use the combination of measurements from these sensors to decide which parcels to water, 
given each parcel has different environmental requirements.
